            <br/>

            <div>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post
                a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
                United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable
                information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
                exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to
                comply with this policy. - See more at:

            <div>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around

                critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

            <div>

                pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
                This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also
                that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.
